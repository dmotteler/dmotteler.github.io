Songperfs.html started out to be a tool to discover the last time a given song was rehearsed or performed.
As the cheat-sheet capability has morphed over time, the pieces fell into place to make a more general tool.

One can select a venue and a date range, click "Show Events", and see a list of events - the performances at that venue in that date range. Select category groups, click "Show Summary", and see how many times we sang each song in the category groups at that venue in that date range, and when each was last sung.

Clicking on an entry in the list of events displays the cheat-sheet for that event.

The events may be searched by name: entering fair in the search box shows all of the events with fair in the event name that happened in the selected date range.

The venue selection has an "All Events" box. Clicking on it when it is not checked sets all of the venue boxes to checked. Clicking it when it is checked clears them all. Clearing one of the other boxes when "All Events" is checked also clears the "All Events" box.

You can check as many of the venues as you want. The selected events will be all those with one of the venue names in the event name.

Selecting "All Events" is a lot like selecting all of the other boxes, except that it really means "All Events", regardless of event name. Events like the Garlic Fest and the SW WA Fair won't be selected by any of the venue boxes.

Typing into the search box clears all of the venue select boxes, in hopes of avoiding confusion.

The category selection doesn't affect the events list, only what song categories to include in the summary. The Current category is selected by default. If you want just the Christmas songs in the summary, you have to clear the Current and select Christmas.

I opted to make category groups rather than make them individually selectable. That would be fairly easy to change, if a better approach becomes clear.

The events list goes back to January 2015, and the date selection won't allow dates before that. The default date range is a year ago today through today.

Not all rehearsals and performances appear, only those for which a songlist was created. Songlists for some of the twice-a-week rehearsals were used for both, for example.

The results can be surprising. More than once, I've doubted that the program was working correctly, but then realized that songs were missing because of the date range. I'm not sure if segregating the summary report by category is worth the confusion it can cause. In fact, I moved the songs that were in the Show category to the Current category in this beta version. I've considered adding a "merge" button, to cause the songs to be presented in one list.
